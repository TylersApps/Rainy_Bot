# Rainy Bot
Rainy Bot is a multi-use Discord bot that I use in my servers. It has many functions (outlined below) and I would love to try new functions so pop an idea in the [issues](https://github.com/tholley7/Rainy_Bot/issues) tab if you have an idea and I will take a look!


## Commands

### Current
- `/help` displays a list of all available commands (different list for admins and non-admins).
- `/randompost <subreddit_name>` gets a random post from the specified subreddit.
- `/roll <(x)d(y)>` rolls x dice with y sides (e.g. "/roll 4d6" rolls four 6-sded dice)

### Planned
- `/define <word>` defines the word passed in using Merriam-Webster's [dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/)
- `/menu <type>` sends the specified menu type to the channel where the command was sent.


## Built With
- [Nextcord](https://nextcord.readthedocs.io/) - Discord API Wrapper
- [Async PRAW](https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code_overview/models/subreddit.html) - Asynchronous Reddit API Wrapper
