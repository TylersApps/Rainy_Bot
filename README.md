# Rainy Bot
Rainy Bot is a multi-use Discord bot that I use in my servers. Made with [Disnake](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/latest/)!

## Planned Commands
- `/help` displays a list of all available commands (different list for admins and non-admins).
- `/random <subreddit>` gets a random post from a specific subreddit.
- `/menu <type>` sends the specified menu type to the channel where the command was sent.
- `/define <word>` defines the word passed in using Merriam-Webster's [dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/)
